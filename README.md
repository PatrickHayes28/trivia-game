This Is TRIVIA GAME!

As a fan of Jeopardy and Alex Trebek I was happy when our instructor told us we would be making a trivia game for our final project. Enjoy the game!

The Rules:

1. Answer the question from a random category

2. get one point if correct

3. its game over if you get a single question wrong and your score resets to zero
